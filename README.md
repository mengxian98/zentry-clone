# Gaming Website Clone with React & Tailwind CSS

This project is a **clone of [Zentry](https://www.zentry.com)**, a modern gaming website - built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. It is developed alongside Javascript Mastery's [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA9r5zTllx4) which provided guidance on the development process, as well as assets for the project.

The objective of this project was to explore **Tailwindâ€™s utility-first design** and experiment with **animations** in a React app. The focus was on creating an interactive UI that closely mirrors the original siteâ€™s look, while also incorporating custom animation tweaks and personal design choices.

> **Note:** This project is a work in progress and is **not fully responsive** at the moment. For the best experience, please view it on a desktop-sized screen. Check the [Planned Enhancements](#planned-enhancements) for upcoming improvements to responsiveness.
